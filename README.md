Name: Mohamed Mohamed

FILES:
My project has 5 file: MM1.php, MM2.php, MM3.php, MM4.php, and style.css
Please all these files in the same folder (including style.css)
I have spent alot of time styling my website to make look proffesional, 
so it's important not to leave out style.css


RUN:
The first file you should run is MM1.php, which is the main page.


SQL Connection:
my servername = "localhost";
my username = "root";
my password = "mysql";
my database name = "COVID";

I have created a new connection for each file. So if you need to change anything 
relating to connecting to SQL in my file, change each connections in each file.
