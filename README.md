RUN:
The first file you should run is MM1.php, which is the main page.


SQL Connection:
my servername = "localhost";
my username = "root";
my password = "mysql";
my database name = "COVID";

I have created a new connection for each file. So if you need to change anything 
relating to connecting to SQL in my file, change each connections in each file.
